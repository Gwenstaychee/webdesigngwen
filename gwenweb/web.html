            <h1>Singer-songwriter Gwen Stefani first gained popularity in the 1990s as the lead singer of No Doubt. She went on to have a highly successful solo career and launch her own clothing line, L.A.M.B. After parting ways with her No Doubt bandmates in the early 2000s to begin a solo career, Stefani reunited with the band in 2012. She has since released more music as solo artist and served as a coach for multiple seasons of the singing competition series The Voice. 
                Gwen Stefani has enjoyed success as the founding member and lead singer of the ska-pop group No Doubt and as a solo artist.</h1>
